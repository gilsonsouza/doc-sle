 <title>Registering &sle; with &scc;</title>
 <info>
  <abstract>
   <para>
    To get technical support and product updates, you need to register and
    activate &productname; with the &scc;. It is recommended to register during
    the installation, since this will enable you to install the system with the
    latest updates and patches available.  However, if you are offline or want
    to skip the registration step, you can register at any time later from the
    installed system.
   </para>
   <para>
    In case your organization provides a local registration server (&susemgr; or
    &smt;), register with the local server rather than with the &scc;. Contact
    your internal IT for help.

  <title>&suse; Account</title>
  <para>
   Registering with the &scc; requires a SUSE account. In case you do not have
   a SUSE account yet, go to the &scc; home page (<link
   xlink:href="https://scc.suse.com/"/>) to create one.
  </para>

 <sect1 xml:id="sec.register_sle.installation">
  <title>Registering During the Installation</title>
  <para>
   The easiest and recommended way to register is to do it during the
   installation. It will not only allow you to install the latest patch level
   of &productname;, but you will also get access to all modules and extensions
   without having to porovide an additional installation media.  For details on
   the registration process refer to <xref
   linkend="sec.yast_install.scc_registration"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
   If the system was successfully registered during installation, YaST will add
   online repositories provided by &scc;. This prevents problems if local
   installation sources are no longer available and ensures that you always get
   the latest updates from the online repositories.
  </para>

 <sect1 xml:id="sec.register_sle.ay">
  <title>Registering during Automated Deployment</title>
  <para>
   If you deploy your instances automatically using &ay;, you can register the
   system during the installation by providing the respective information in
   the &ay; control file. Refer to <xref linkend="CreateProfile.Register"/> for
   details.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="sec.register_sle.system">
  <title>Registering from the Installed System</title>
  <para>
   If you have skipped the registration during the installation or want to
   re-register your system, you can register the system at any time using the
   YaST module <guimenu>Product Registration</guimenu> or the command line tool
   <command>SUSEConnect</command>.
  </para>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec.register_sle.system.yast">
   <title>Registering with YaST</title>
   <para>
    To register the system start <menuchoice><guimenu>YaST</guimenu>
    <guimenu>Software</guimenu> <guimenu>Product
    Registation</guimenu></menuchoice>.  Provide the E-mail address associated
    with the &suse; account you or your organization uses to manage
    subscriptions.
   </para>
   <para>
    Enter the <guimenu>Registration Code</guimenu> you received with your copy
    of &productname;. Proceed with <guimenu>Next</guimenu> to start the
    registration process.
   </para>
   <para>
    By default the system is registered with the &scc;.  However, if your
    organization provides local regsitration servers you can either choose one
    form the list of auto-detected servers or provide the URl at
    <guimenu>Register System via local SMT Server</guimenu>. Proceed with
    <guimenu>Next</guimenu> to finish the registration.
   </para>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec.register_sle.system.suseconnect">
   <title>Registering with SUSEConnect</title>
   <para>
    To register from the command line, use the command
   </para>
   <screen>&prompt.user;sudo SUSEConnect -r <replaceable>REGISTRATION_CODE</replaceable> -e <replaceable>EMAIL_ADDRESS</replaceable></screen>
   <para>
    Replace <replaceable>REGISTRATION_CODE</replaceable> with the registration
    code you received with your copy of &productname;. Replace
    <replaceable>EMAIL_ADDRESS</replaceable> with the E-mail address associated
    with the &suse; account you or your organization uses to manage
    subscriptions.
   </para>
   <para>
    THis <command>SUSEconnect</command> command will only register the base
    system of &productname;. See <xref
    linkend="sec.register_sle.system.suseconnect.extension"/> on how to
    register other system components.
   </para>
   <para>
   To register with a local registration server, additionally provide the URL
   to the server:
   </para>
   <screen>&prompt.user;sudo SUSEConnect -r <replaceable>REGISTRATION_CODE</replaceable> -e <replaceable>EMAIL_ADDRESS</replaceable> \
--url "https://suse_register.example.com/"</screen>

   <sect3 xml:id="sec.register_sle.system.suseconnect.extension">
